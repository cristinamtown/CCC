    "<u>**Analysis Questions**</u>: The new intervention has been up and running for a full year, and everyone seems to think it’s very successful. However, the new intervention costs about 50% more than the “usual care.” Our leaders have asked for an analysis of the effectiveness of the new intervention. Key questions include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "- Is the new intervention better than “usual care”?\n",
    "- Which clients are best served by the intervention?\n",
    "- Should we expand the care model from the new intervention to our “usual care” team?\n",
