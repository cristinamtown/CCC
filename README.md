# CCC

**Scenario**: Central City Concern is proud to be an innovator in the delivery of complex care interventions. Last year, we began piloting a new mental health intervention, which provides flexible, highly-tailored mental health and substance use disorder services in combination with housing. We randomly assigned existing mental health clients to the new intervention to support rigorous future analysis.

**Analysis Questions**: The new intervention has been up and running for a full year, and everyone seems to think it’s very successful. However, the new intervention costs about 50% more than the “usual care.” Our leaders have asked for an analysis of the effectiveness of the new intervention. Key questions include (but are not limited to):
Is the new intervention better than “usual care”?
Which clients are best served by the intervention?
Should we expand the care model from the new intervention to our “usual care” team?

**Your Task**: Produce a brief analysis that addresses the effectiveness of the new intervention. You may focus on any of the three key questions, or you may take a different approach if you believe it will provide better insight. You will have 20 minutes at an upcoming leadership meeting (a.k.a., the interview) to present your primary results and answer questions. Please prepare a PowerPoint presentation with no more than three slides that capture your findings.
